# Rasterizer Project

## Overview 
This project implements a set of rasterization functions in a graphics library, including basic shapes, complex polygons, and creative designs like fractal trees and hearts. The core functionality includes drawing line segments, rectangles, stars, polygons, circles, and more advanced geometric figures. Uses the GFX library which contains functionality for handling mathematic functions in V, image creation, and color qualities. This library was given to me by my professor. 

## Features 
### Basic Rasterization Functions:

- Draw horizontal and vertical line segments.
- Draw rectangles and polygons.
- Draw simple stars and circles.

### Advanced Rasterization:

- Rasterize regular polygons with variable sides.
- Generate fractal trees with customizable parameters.
- Rasterize filled shapes such as semi-circles and hearts.

### Image Generation:

- Save rendered images in PNG format.
- Create animations, such as a beating heart, by generating a sequence of images.
